## Introduction

Yet another to-do list app, created in HTML, JS and CSS. This project is an extension of with added features I wanted to try out. 

## Features

Core Features:
- Add items to a list, with a timestamp.
- Remove individual items.
- Mark items as completed, with a timestamp.
Additional Features:
- List is saved as a localstorage object
- Export list as a .CSV file
Work in Progress:
- Proper formatting
- Clean up CSS and layout
- Proper warning when you reset the app

## Bugs/Issues

When page is refreshed, the elements will disappear, however, they will still persist in localstorage (unless you Reset App). Clicking the Refresh App will pull the items from localstorage and the list will reappear. 

## Usage

Strongly recommend reviewing the original source from Avinash Kr on YouTube as a proper starting point since my version is still very much buggy and basic. 

However, feel free to clone and modify my source for yourself, maybe you can go further than I have.
